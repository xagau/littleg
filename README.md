# littleg
little-g programming language

Much more advanced programming language than VASM.
Littleg attempts to evaluate sophisitcated expressions, 
objects, strings, characters, enum types, native support 
for large decimal numbers and a default 64 bit byte instruction type.

The project is far from complete - however colourized particles
are now compiled, classes contain particle subsets.

Next steps will be (in no particular order):
 
 - General clean up and refactoring and optimization of Particle classes

 - To evaluate complex expressions to a single value

 - Add error handling
 
 - Add built-in distributed library importation, removing the 
 requirement for package managers such as maven or pip.
 
 - Add native support for streams of all types
 
 - Add an interactive debugger
 
 - Set allow for watch addresses
 
 - Attach suitable logging facilities
 
 - Stack (push/pop) management for function invocation.
 
 - New object instantiation
 
 - Native support for high performance collections
 
 - Function/object/native visibility attributes
 
 - Function/object/native annotation
 
 - Self compilation as proof of the language being turing complete.
 
 - Automatic Garbage collection for unreferenced memory on pop operations.
