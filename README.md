little-g programming language

Slightly more advanced programming language than VASM as this one implies sophisitcated expressions, objects and may be a more interesting project to work on while Covid19 rages on. It is currently under pretty heady construction so I woulndn't bother looking at it right now. I have a few ideas of how I can use this together with git in the future.
